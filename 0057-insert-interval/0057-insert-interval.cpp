            res.push_back(intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }                           
		//case 2: overlapping case and merging of intervals
        while(i < n && newInterval[1] >= intervals[i][0]){
            newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
            newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        res.push_back(newInterval);
        // case 3: no overlapping of intervals after newinterval being merged
        while(i < n){
            res.push_back(intervals[i]);
            i++;

// Case 2 explanation,
// {[6,8], [10,12], [15,16], [20,22], [23,24]}
// and we need to insert [13,18]

// The first while loop will make result = {[6,8], [10,12]}. Then we terminate on [15,16] since 16 is !< 13.
// Then the second while loop will compare [13,18] and [15,16] and see if 18 >= 15. Yes, this is true. So we update newInterval to be [13,18]. This part might be confusing, but bear with me. Now we compare [13,18] and [20,22]. Here, 18 >= 20 is NOT true, so we terminate. And then insert into result so result = {[6,8], [10,12], [13,18]}. As I said earlier, the easier way to think about this is that 18 < 20, meaning there is no longer an overlap, and we can now terminate the loop.
